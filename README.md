# Supervised-Learning-with-Spiking-Neural-Networks
Building a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based model to predict real time frequency based data of Blood Pressure and other biometric measures.
->Analyzing combination of time & frequency-domain data of Blood pressure given by wearable biometric monitors.
->Understanding the inconsistent results due to motion artifacts and low spatial resolution and working on improvising it.
->Building a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based model to give accurate results with lesser power consumption. 
->Exploring the gap and challenges in the literature, and proposing solutions and future direction of research.
This is a ongoing project, final results are yet to be published.
